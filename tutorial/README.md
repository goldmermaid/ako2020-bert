### Environment Setup
1. At the first time to run the scripts, please run `bash sagemaker-lifecycle.config` to config the MXNet and GluonNLP environment. (If you have set lifecycle config when you initiate the sagemaker instance, please ignore this step.)
2. Launch a notebook instance with at least 100 GB disk storage.
3. Open up the jupyter notebook and have fun!
